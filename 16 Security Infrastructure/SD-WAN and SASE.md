# Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN)

Virtualized approach to managing and optimizing wide area network connections to efficiently route traffic between rermote sites, data centers, and cloud environments

uses a centralized control function to securely and intelligently route traffic accross the wide area network (WAN).
allows us to use:
- MPLS
- Cellular Connection
- Microwave Link
- Broadband Internet

# Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)

Used to consolidate numerous networking and security functions into a single cloud-native service to ensure that secure and access for end-users can be achieved

Uses [[Software-Defined Networking (SDN)]] to provide security and networking services from the cloud rather than hardware based appliances.

- Secure
- Flexible
- Global
Networking Capabilities

Typically include
- Firewalls
- VPNs
- Zero-Trust network access
- CASBs (Cloud Access Security Brokers)

- PRovides a more secure and efficient way to connect all the users to their services

Example:
- AWS (Amazon web services) calls their closest solution a Virtual Private Cloud

- Microsoft Azure (Azure Virtual WAN)
  - Azure Express route
- Google Cloud Platform (Google Cloud Interconnect)
