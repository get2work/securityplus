# Accounting

Security measure that ensures all user activities are properly tracked and recorded

Implement:
[[Audit Trail]]
[[Regulatory Compliance]]
[[Forensic Analysis]]
[[Resource Optimization]]
[[User Accountability]]

To perform accountability, we can use:
[[Syslog servers]]
[[Network Analyzers]]
[[SIEM]]

# Audit Trail

Provides a chronological record of all user activites that can be used to trace changes, unauthorized access, or anomalies back to a specific user or a point in time

# Regulatory Compliance

Objective that organizations aim to reach in adherence to applicable laws, policies, and regulations

# Forensic Analysis

Uses detailed accounting and event logs that can help cybersecurity experts understand what happened, how it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents from occuring again in the future.

# Resource Optimization

Organizations can optimize system performance and minimize costs by tracking resource utilization and allocation decisions

# User Accountability

Thorough accounting system ensures users' actions are monitored and logged, deterring potential misuse and promoting adherence to the organization's policies

# Syslog servers

Used to aggregate logs from various network devices and systems so that system administrators can analyze them to detect patterns or anomalies in the organization's systems

# Network Analyzers

Used to capture and analyze network traffic to gain detailed insights into all the data moving within a network

# SIEM

Security Information and Event Management

Provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by various hardware and software infrastructures in an organization
