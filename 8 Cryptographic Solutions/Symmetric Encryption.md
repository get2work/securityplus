# Symmetric Encryption
- Single key
- (Private Key) Both the sender and receiver must know the same shared secret using a privately held key
- Same key used for encryption and decryption

# Data Encryption Standard (DES)

Encryption algorithm which breaks the input into 64-bit blocks and uses transposition and substitution to create ciphertext using an effective key strength of only 56 bits

# Triple DES (3DES)

Encryption algorithm which uses three separate symmetric keys to encrypt, decrypt, the encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext to increase the strength of DES

# International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)

Symmetric block cipher whih uses 64-bit blocks to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext

# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Symmetric block cipher that uses 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit blocks and a matching encryption key size to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext

# Blowfish

Symmetric block cipher that uses 64=bit blocks and a variable length encryption key to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext

# Twofish

Provides the ability to use 128-bit blocks in its encryption algorithm and uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit encryption keys

# RC Cipher Suite

Create by Ron Rivest, a cryptographer who;s created six algorithms under the name RC which stands for the Rivest Cipher

# Rivest Cipher (RC4)

Symmetric Stream Cipher using a variable key size from 40-bits to 2048-bits that is used in [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)]] and WEP

# Rivest Cipher (RC5)

Symmetric block cipher that uses key sizes up to 2048-bits

# Rivest Cipher (RC6)

Symmetric block cipher that was introduced as a replacement for [[Data Encryption Standard (DES)]] but [[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] was chosen instead
