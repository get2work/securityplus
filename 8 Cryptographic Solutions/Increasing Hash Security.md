# Pass the Hash Attack

Hacking technique that allows the attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying hash of a user's password instead of requiring the associated plaintext password
- @Mimikatz : Provides the ability to automate the process of harvesting the hashes and conducting the attack

# Birthday Attack

When an attacker is able to send two different messages through a hash algorithm and it results in the same identical hash digest, reffered to as a @Collision

# Key Stretching

Technique that is used to mitigate a weaker key by increasing the time needed to crack it 

# Salting

Adding random data into a one-way cryptographic hash to help protect against password cracking techniques

# Dictionary Attack

When an attacker tries every word in a list

# Brute-force Attack

When an attacker tries every posslbe password combination

# Rainbow Tables

Precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions

# Nonce (Number Used Once)
is a nunique, often random number that is added to a pssword based authentication process
