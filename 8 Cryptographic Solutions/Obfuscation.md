# Steganography
- Derived from Greek words meaning "Covered writing"
- The practice of hiding secret data within ordinary, non-secret files or messages to avoid detection
- Primary goal here isnt just to prevent unauthorized access to the data, but to prevent the suspicion that there's any hidden data at all
- Frequently used alongside encryption for an extra layer of security

# Tokenization

Replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes, known as tokens

# Data Masking

- Replacing some or all of the data in a field with a placeholder, such as "x" to hide the original content
- Obscuring data within a database to make it inaccessible for unauthorized users while retaining the real data's authenticity and use for authorized users
