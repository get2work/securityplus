# Cryptographic Attacks

- Techniques and strategies that adversaries employ to exploit vulnerabilites in cryptographic systems with the intent to to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity of data.

# Downgrade Attacks

- Aims to force a system into using a weaker or older cryptographic standard or protocol than what it's currently using

# Collision Attack

Aims to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output

# Quantum Computing

A computer that uses quantum mechanics to generate and manupulate quantum bits (qubits) in order to access enormous processing powers

- Instead of using ones and zeros it uses quantum bits or qubits

- WIth quantum computing, complex math problems and asymmetric encryption math problems, can be solved more easily.

# Quantum Communication

A communication netowrk that relies on [[Qubit]]s made of photons (light) to send multiple combinations of ones and zeros simultaneously which results in tamper resistant and extremely fast communications

# Qubit

A quantum bit composed of electrons or photons that can represent numerous combinations of ones and zeros at the same time through superposition

- Designed for very specific use cases, such as very complex math problems or trying to do something like the modeling of an atom or some kind of atomic structure.

- Cryptography is used to secure communications and data by relying on how difficult  a math problem is to compute with traditional computers, thats what gives the strength in cryptography.

# Post-Quantum Cryptography

A new kind of cryptographic algorithm that can be implemented using today's classical computers but it is also impervious to attacks from future quantum computers.
