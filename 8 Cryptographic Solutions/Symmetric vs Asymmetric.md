# Hybrid Implementation
- Utilizes [[Asymmetric Algorithms]] to securely transfer a private key that can then be used with [[Symmetric Encryption]]

# Stream Cipher
- Utilizes a keystream generator to encrypt data bit by bit using a mathematical XOR function to create the ciphertext

# Block Cipher
- Breaks the input into fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryption on each block
