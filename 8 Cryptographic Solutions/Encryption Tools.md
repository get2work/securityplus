# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

Dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys

# Hardware Security Module (HSM)

Physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys, primarily used for mission-critical situations like financial transactions
- Generates cryptographic keys
- provides accelerated cryptographic operations
- If network is breached, individual keys are still stored and managed by the @HSM

# Key Management System (KMS)

Integrated approach for generating, distributing, and managing cryptographic keys for devices and applications

# Secure Enclave

Co-processor integrated into the main processor of some devices, designed with the sole purpose of ensuring data protection.

Even if a device gets compromised, the data within the Secure Enclave remains untouched.
