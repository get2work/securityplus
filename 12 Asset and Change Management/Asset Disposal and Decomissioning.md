  - Destruction
  - Certification
  
# Sanitization

The thorough process of making data inaccessible and irretrievable from a storage medium using traditional forensic methods
- Overwriting data: single pass, 7 pass, 35 passes

# Degaussing

Involves using a machine called a degausser to produce a strong magnetic field that can disrupt the magnetic domains on storage devices like hard drives or tapes.

# Secure Erase

Completely deletes data from a storage device while ensuring that it can't be recovered using traditional recovery tools

# Cryptographic Erase

Data is stored encrypted and cryptographic erase deletes the keys. Its faster to delete the keys than deleting the data. Data remains encrypted

# Destruction

Ensures the physical device itself is beyond recovery or reuse
    - Shredding
    - pulverizing
    - melting
    - incinerating

# Certification

An act of proof that the data or hardware has been securely disposed of
