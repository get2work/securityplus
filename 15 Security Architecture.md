# Security Architecture
Design, structure, and behavior of an organization's information security environment

# On-Premise

Traditional method of setting up infrastructure and services locally, within an organization's own premises

# Cloud Computing

Involves delivering computing services over the internet

[[On-premise vs the Cloud]]

**Concepts**
- [[Responsibility Matrix]]
- [[Third-Party Vendors]]
- [[Hybrid Solutions]]
- [[On-Premise]]

**Things to COnsider**
- Availability
- [[Cyber Resilience]]
- **Cost**: Consider immediate and long-term cost
- **Responsiveness**: speed at which the system can adapt to changes in traffic
- **Scalability** : Ability to scale in workload
- **Ease of Deployment** : Cloud easier to deploy
- **Risk Transference** : When using the cloud services, some risks are transferred to the provider
- **Patch Availability**
- **Inability to Patch**
- **Power**: Electrical power consumption and backup power
- **Compute**: Amount of computational resources a customer can use
