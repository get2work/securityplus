# Spike

A short transient voltage that is usually caused by a short circuit, a tripped circuit breaker, a power outage, or a lightning strike

# Sag

A small and unexpected decrease in the amount of voltage that is being provided

# Undervoltage Event

Occurs when the voltage is reduced to lower levels and usually occur for a longer period of time

# Power Loss Event

Occurs when there is a total loss of power for a given period of time
