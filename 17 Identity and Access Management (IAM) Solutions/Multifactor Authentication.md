# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity

- Knowledge-based Factor (password/pin/secret question)
- Posession-based Factor (smart card/keyfob/software token (authenticator app/sms one-time code))
- Inherence-based Factor (Biometric characteristics (fingerprints/facial recognition/voice recognition/iris scans))
- Behavior-based Factor (user-specific patterns, keystrokes/mouse movement/walk)
- Location-based Factor (determining a user's location to help auth them)

# Single-Factor Authentication

Using a single authentication factor to access a user account

# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Using two different authentication factors to gain access to a system

# Passkeys
