# Exploit Technique

Involves methods by which malware infiltrates and infects targeted systems 

# Exploit Attack Stages

+ @Stage-1: [[Dropper]] or [[Downloader]]
  - When a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious file, malware is installed
  
+ @Stage-2: [[Downloader]]
  - Download and install a [[Remote Acces Trojan (RAT)]] to conduct command and control on the victimized system

+ @Actions-on-Objectives-Phase: 
  - Threat actors will execute primary objectives ([[Data Exfiltration]] or file [[Encryption]])

+ Final step: @Concealment
  - Used to help the threat actor prolong their attack by hiding their tracks, erasing log files
  
# Living off the land

The threat actors try to exploit the standard system tools to perform intrustions

# Fileless Malware

Used to create a process in the system memory without relying on the local file system of the infected host:
- Ex: [[Shellcode]]

# Dropper

Initiates or runs other malware forms within a payload on an infected host

# Downloader

Retrieves additional tools post the initial infection facilitated by a dropper

# Shellcode

Encompasses lightweight code meant to execute an exploit on a given target
