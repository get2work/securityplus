# Visual Obstruction

Blocking the camera's line of sight (paint on camera, etc)

# Blind Sensors and Camera

Overwhelming the sensor or camera with a sudden burst of light to render it ineffective for a limited period of time.

# Acoustic Interference

Jamming or playing loud music to disrupt the microphone's functionality

# Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

Jamming the signals that surveillance systems rely on to monitor the environment

# Physical Environment Attack

Exploiting the environment around the surveillance equipment to compromise its functionality

# Physical Tampering

Cutting wires, or physically disablign devices, is an effective strategy to bypass surveillance systems

    - Some systems may have tamper alarms
    - Backup power supplies/UPS
    - Encrypted Frequency hopping signals to guard against jamming and eavesdrop attempts
