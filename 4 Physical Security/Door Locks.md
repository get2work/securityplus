# Door Locks

Physical security control that is designed to secure entryways by restricting and regulating access to a particular space or property

 - Physical and Electronic
 - Biometric Locks ( Measured by their [[False Acceptance Rate]] and theor [[False Rejection Rate]]. You should use [[Equal Error Rate]]/[[Crossover Error Rate]] to determine which biometric lock you want for your system.)
  - Cypher Lock: Provides excellent protection using a mechanical locking mechanism with push buttons that are numbered and require a person to enter the correct combination in order to open that door.
  - Combining multiple authentication methods, such as using both a PIN and a fingerprint, can also further increase the physical security posture.

# False Acceptance Rate
(FAR)
The rate that the system authenticates a user as valid, even though that person should not have been granted access to the system.

# False Rejection Rate
(FRR)
Occurs any time the biometrics system denies a user who should have been allowed to the system

# Equal Error Rate
(ERR)
More Commonly Called [[Crossover Error Rate]]

# Crossover Error Rate
(CER)
Which uses a measure of the effectiveness of a given biometrics system to achieve a balance.
WHere your [[False Acceptance Rate]] and [[False Rejection Rate]] intersect.
