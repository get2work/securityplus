# Access Badge Cloning

Refers to copying the data from an [[RFID]] or [[NFC]] card or badge onto another card or device

**Access Badge Cloning Steps**
1. Scanning: An attacker can use a handheld [[RFID]] or [[NFC]] reader to capture data from a victim's card and store it for further processing

2. Data Extraction: Once the data is captured, attackers extract the relevant authentication credentials from the card.
   
3. Writing to a new card or device: Using specialized tooles, the attacker will then transfert he extracted data into a blank [[RFID]] or [[NFC]] card
   
4. Using the cloned access badge: Now that the attacker has their cloned access badge or device in hand, they can gain unauthorized access to buildings, computer systems, or even make payments.
   
**Access Badge Cloning Concerns for Cyber Sec**
- Ease of execution
- Ability to be stealthy when conducting the attack
- Potentially large use in compromising physical security

**How to stop access badge cloning**
1. Implement advanced encryption in card-based authentication systems
2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
3. Regularly Update Security Protocols
4. Educate the users
5. Users should implement the use of shielded wallets or sleeves with RFID access badges
6. Monitor and audit the access logs
