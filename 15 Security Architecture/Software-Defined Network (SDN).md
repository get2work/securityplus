# Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

Network management method that allows dynamic and efficient network configuration to improve performance and monitoring

Made possible through three distinct planes:

- [[SDN Data Plane]]
- [[SDN Control Plane]]
- [[Application Plane]]
  
# SDN Data Plane

Also called the forwarding plane that is responsible for handling packets and makes decisions based on protocols

# SDN Control Plane

The brain of the network that decides where traffic is sent and is centralized in SDN

# Application Plane

The plane where all network applications interacting with the SDN controller reside
