# Embedded System

Specialized computing component designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger structure

- Vulnerabilities
  - Hardware Failures
  - Software Bugs
  - Security Vulnerabilities
  - Outdated Systems
  - [[Inability to Patch]]

# Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

Enssures data processing in real-time and is crucial for time-sensitive applications

# Network Segmentation

Divides a network int omultiple segments or subnets, limiting potential damage in case of a breach

# Wrappers

Show only the entry and exit points of the data when travelling between networks

Only shows the [[Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)]] header

# Firmware Code Control

This can be achieved through secure coding practices, code reviews, and automated testing
- Secure boot mechanisms
- Cryptographic Signatures

# Inability to Patch
Strategies like over-the-air (OTA) updates, where patches are delivered and installed remotely, can be applied.
