# Shared Physical Server Vulnerabilities
- Can lead to vulnerabilities if one user's data is compromised on the same server u are on

# Inadequate Virtual Environment Security

Can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents

# Single Points of Failure

Can lead to a complete system outage affecting all users
 - Use Multiple Servers, Data Centers, Cloud providers

# Weak Authentication and Encryption Practices

Can lead to allowing unauthorized users to gain access to cloud systems

- Multi-Factor Authentication
- Strong Encryption Algorithms
- Secure Key Management Practices

# Unclear Policies

Lack of clear guidelines or procedures for various security aspects

# Data Remnants

Residual data left behind after deletion or erasure processes
