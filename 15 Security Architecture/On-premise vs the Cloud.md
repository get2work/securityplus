# On-premise vs the Cloud
[[Cloud Computing]]
- Servers
+ Storage
- Databases
+ Networking
- Software Analytics
+ Intelligence

**Concepts**
- [[Responsibility Matrix]]
- [[Third-Party Vendors]]
- [[Hybrid Solutions]]
- [[On-Premise]]

**Things to COnsider**
- Availability
- [[Cyber Resilience]]
- Cost : Consider immediate and long-term cost
- Responsiveness: speed at which the system can adapt to changes in traffic
- Scalability : Ability to scale in workload
- Ease of Deployment : Cloud easier to deploy
- Risk Transference : When using the cloud services, some risks are transferred to the provider
- Patch Availability
- Inability to Patch
- Power: Electrical power consumption and backup power
- Compute: Amount of computational resources a customer can use

# Responsibility Matrix

- Outlines the division of responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the customer
  - Ex: Operating System, Middleware, Runtime, Data, Application

# Third-Party Vendors

- Provide specialized services that enhance the functionality, security, and efficiency of cloud solutions

# Hybrid Solutions

Combine on-premise infrastructure, private cloud services, and public cloud services
