# Hardware Vulnerabilities

Security flaws or weaknesses inherent in a device's physical components or design that can be exploited to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system and its data

# Firmware

Specialized form of software stored on hardware device, like a router or a smart thermostat, that provides low-level control for the device's specific hardware

# End-of-life Systems

# Unsupported Systems

Hardware or software products that no longer receive official technical support, security updates, or patches from their respective vendors or developers

# Unpatched System

Device, application, or piece of software that has not been updated with the latest security patches so that it remains vulnerable to known exploits and attacks

# Hardware Misconfiguration

Occurs when a device's settings, parameters, or options are not optimally set up, and this can cause vulnerabilities to exist, a decrease in performance, or unintended behavior of devices or systems

# Hardening

Involves tightening the security of a system

# Patching

Involves the regular updating of the software, firmware, and applications with the latest security patches

# Configuration Enforcement

Used to ensure that all devices and systems adhere to a standard secure configuration

# Decomissioning
