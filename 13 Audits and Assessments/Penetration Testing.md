# Penetration Testing (Pentesting)

Simulated cyber attack that helps in the assessment of computer systems for exploitable vulnerabilities

- [[Physical Pentesting]]
- [[Offensive Pentesting (Red Teaming)]]
- [[Defensive Pentesting (Blue Teaming)]]
- [[Integrated Pentesting (Purple Teaming)]]

# Physical Pentesting

Testing the physical sec of an org by testing its locks, access cards, sec cameras, and other protective measures

- Identify phjysical vulnerabilities
- improve sec awareness
- prevent unauthorized access

# Offensive Pentesting (Red Teaming)

Proactive approach that involves use of attack techniques, akin to real cyber threats, that seek and exploit system vulnerabilities

# Defensive Pentesting (Blue Teaming)

Reactive approach that entails fortifying systems, identifying and addressing attacks, and enhancing incident response times


# Integrated Pentesting (Purple Teaming)

Combination of aspects of both offensive and defensive testing into a single penetration test
