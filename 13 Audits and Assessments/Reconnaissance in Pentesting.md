# Reconnaissance

An initial phase where critical info about a target system is gathered to enhance an attack's effectiveness and success
- [[Active Reconnaissance]]
- [[Passive Reconnaissance]]
- [[Known Environment]]
- [[Partially Known Environment]]
- [[Unknown Environment]]

# Active Reconnaissance

- Direct engagement with the target system, offering more information but with a higher detection risk

# Passive Reconnaissance

- Gathering Information without direct engagement with the target system, offering lower detection risk but less data

# Known Environment

Detailed target infrastructure information from the organization is received prior to the test
- Focuses on known assets
- Evaluates vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- Aims to understand exploitability and potential damages
- Resembles an insider threat scenario

# Partially Known Environment
- Involves limited information provided to testers, who may have partial knowledge of the system

# Unknown Environment

- Testers receive minimal to no information about the target system
