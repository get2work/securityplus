# Cyber Resilience

Entity's ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events

# Cyber Redundancy

Envolves having additional systems, equipment, or processes to ensure continued functionality if the primary ones fail

# Data Redundancy 

Achieved by having redundant storage devices all working together to protect data
