# Pretexting

Tricking the customer service representative by saying some fake information about one of their devices.
Example: Do you guys still have the hp laserjet? "No we have a nokia 81293 actually!"

**PREVENTION**

Train the employees not to fall for pretext and to not fill in the gaps for people when they are calling
