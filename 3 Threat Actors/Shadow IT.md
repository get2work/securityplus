# Shadow IT

- The use of IT systems, devices, software, applications, and services without explicit organizational approval. Can improve organization efficiency but also poses substantial security risks. Must try to strike a healthy balance.

- Example: installing software, new monitor, new usb devices. Web browser plugins or extensions

- Poses a significant risk. Unsanctioned technology leads to a lack of awareness by the cybersecurity team regarding the network's structure
